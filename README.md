__How Much Does the Mercedes-Benz S-Class Cost?__
Even by super luxury car standards, the S-Class is expensive. Its __base price of around $91,000__ is more than almost every competitor. Compared to the higher S-Class trims, that's downright cheap. For example, the most expensive model in the lineup is the AMG S 65 cabriolet, which starts a few lattes north of $250,000.
